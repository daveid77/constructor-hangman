# Constructor Hangman

Week Six Homework Part 1: [Advanced Javascript Constructor Assignment](http://ucb.bootcampcontent.com/UCB-Coding-Bootcamp/09-11-2017-UCB-Class-Repository-FSF-FT/blob/master/06-week/homework/part-1/HomeworkInstructions.md).

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/dbmarshall/constructor-hangman.git
cd constructor-hangman
npm install
```

## Available Node Commands

* `node game.js`

## Little Extras

* Letter validation built in.  Won't accept integers or multi-character strings. 
* Capitalization of user inputted letter doesn't effect comparisons or display.
* Choice to play more offered to user, rather than auto game restart as in demo GIF.

## Shortcomings

* No prototypes used, as per assignment requirements, although updateDisplayString() sort of acts like a prototype, I think. 
* Doesn't check for repeated user entries (yet?).

## Author
